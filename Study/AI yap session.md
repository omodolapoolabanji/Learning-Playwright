Symbol systems in training AI models and the Chinese room experiment and combinatorial expansion.
Strong AI - all behaviors expected from fabricated person (General AI)
Weak AI - Confined to very narrow task set. -> Symbolic systems paradigm. (GOFAI)

Planning Artificial Intelligence -> Heuristic reasoning, limits possibilities / search space. Think Maps and GPS systems. 

Machine Learning:
Training a program to learn to teach itself patterns. 
The machine makes these pattern matchings based on data being fed to it. They can identify patterns that the user does not even know about yet. 


Neural Networks:
Neurons are organized into layers (input layers -> output layers) - > hidden layers in between.
Uses large scale trial and error and a system of confidence scores. 

Perceptrons:
